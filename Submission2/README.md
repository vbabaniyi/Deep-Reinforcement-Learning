Follow the https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in README.md at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

Then, place the file in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

After you have followed the instructions above, open Continuous_Control.ipynb (located in the p2_continuous-control/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository) and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

In this project I used the version which is made of one agent.The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, my agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes. My environment was solved in 686 episodes.
